              The Radeon RX 7900 XTX is an enthusiast-class graphics card by
              AMD, launched on November 3rd, 2022. Built on the 5 nm process,
              and based on the Navi 31 graphics processor, in its Navi 31 XTX
              variant, the card supports DirectX 12 Ultimate. This ensures that
              all modern games will run on Radeon RX 7900 XTX. Additionally, the
              DirectX 12 Ultimate capability guarantees support for
              hardware-raytracing, variable-rate shading and more, in upcoming
              video games. The Navi 31 graphics processor is a large chip with a
              die area of 529 mmÂ² and 57,700 million transistors. It features
              6144 shading units, 384 texture mapping units, and 192 ROPs. The
              card also has 96 raytracing acceleration cores. AMD has paired 24
              GB GDDR6 memory with the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, which are connected
              using a 384-bit memory interface. The GPU is operating at a
              frequency of 1929 MHz, which can be boosted up to 2498 MHz, memory
              is running at 2500 MHz (20 Gbps effective). Being a dual-slot
              card, the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX draws power from 2x 8-pin power
              connectors, with power draw rated at 355 W maximum. Display
              outputs include: 1x HDMI 2.1a, 2x DisplayPort 2.1, 1x USB Type-C.
              Radeon RX 7900 XTX is connected to the rest of the system using a
              PCI-Express 4.0 x16 interface. The card's dimensions are 287 mm x
              110 mm x 51 mm, and it features a dual-slot cooling solution. Its
              price at launch was 999 US Dollars.

              The AMD next-generation we've long been waiting for is finally
              here! The new Radeon RX 7900 XTX in this review, and the Radeon RX
              7900 XT, which we're also reviewing today, debut the company's 3rd
              generation RDNA graphics architecture, or RDNA 3. With it, the
              company is also introducing the world's first chiplet-based GPU in
              an effort to maximize utilization of the TSMC 5 nm foundry node,
              without compromising on performance, or too much on power. The
              RDNA 3 graphics architecture promises a similar 50% leap in
              performance/Watt over the previous-generation RDNA 2, which helped
              AMD compete in the high-end segment after a long gap of 7-odd
              years. The new architecture improves in many areas, including
              compute power, memory sub-system, display engine with support for
              the latest DisplayPort 2.1 standard, multiple-stream acceleration
              for the latest video formats, and most importantly, AI
              acceleration, and a more advanced ray tracing hardware.
            </p>

            <p class="info2">
              AMD's decision to leverage chiplets to build the new "Navi 31" GPU
              powering the Radeon RX 7900 series, has to do with attempting to
              keep Moore's Law alive in spirit. The idea is to achieve high-end
              performance leadership at the same sub-$1000 price-points that
              we've had before. NVIDIA on the other hand considers Moore's Law
              dead, and says that it's no longer possible to economically build
              large high-end GPUs. AMD therefore identified all the components
              that can do with a slightly older foundry nodeâsuch as the L3
              cache, memory controllers, and memory PHY, and moved them from the
              GPU, onto six little dies called MCDs (memory cache dies), which
              are built on the slightly older 6 nm process. The remaining GPU
              with all its compute-intensive hardware, would be called the GCD
              (graphics compute die). The GCD and MCDs would be connected by an
              extreme bandwidth Infinity Fabric Fanout interconnect, which
              enables 5.4 TB/s of bandwidth between the GCD and MCDs. Each MCD
              has a 16 MB segment of the GPU's total 96 MB Infinity Cache, which
              is a bit smaller than the 128 MB of the previous generation, but
              made up for by the 87% higher GDDR6 memory bandwidth from the
              GPU's 384-bit memory bus, handling 20 Gbps-rated memory, for 960
              GB/s of bandwidth.
            </p>

            <p class="info3">
              The RDNA 3 graphics architecture which we're reviewing today,
              introduces dual issue-rate compute units, with a high degree of
              optimization in the way idle SIMD resources are utilized, support
              for newer math formats, and a new AI accelerator that retasks the
              SIMDs for matrix math functions. Together, these optimizations
              produce a 17% IPC uplift over the previous-generation RDNA 2 CU.
              There are 96 CUs physically present in the silicon, which work out
              to 6,144 stream processors. The architecture also sees an increase
              in engine clocks, and a decoupling of the shader clock speeds to
              those of the GPU's Front End, which operates at a 10-15% higher
              frequency. The most striking aspect of the RDNA 3 architecture is
              that the typical board power of these GPUs is well contained, with
              the RX 7900 XTX rated at just 350 W, and the RX 7900 XT at 315
              Wâboth of which can be fed by just two 8-pin PCIe power
              connectors, and cooled by solutions much smaller than those you
              find on the competing NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 or RTX 4090 "Ada."
            </p>

            <p class="info4">
              The Radeon RX 7900 XTX we're reviewing here, maxes out the "Navi
              31" silicon, featuring all 96 compute units, or all 6,144 stream
              processors, 96 second generation Ray Accelerators, 384 TMUs, a
              whopping 192 ROPs, and the GPU's whole 384-bit memory interface,
              holding 24 GB of 20 Gbps-rated GDDR6 memory. All this for "just"
              $1,000, or the same price the previous-generation RX 6900 XT
              debuted at. This is where AMD's choices with the chiplet
              architecture begins to make sense, as both of NVIDIA's competing
              GPUs are priced much higher.
